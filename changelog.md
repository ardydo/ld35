# jogatinaJun16 (19/06/2016)
The version I took to Jogatina com Prosa. A local indie dev meeting

## Gameplay
* Extra keys - now supporting WASD and up keys to jump.
* Lowered green form speed to make it easier to control
* Lowered esteira drag speed because of this
* World 1 and 2 remade
* Lots and lots of small collision changes
* F keys now used to warp around worlds

## Other
* changed world naming because world 0 was a stupid idea, so the first world is w1
* Lots of small bugfixes
* f12 take you to the old levels

# indiecamp0516 (21/05/2016)
The version I took at the second meeting and that I had worked on most of the feedback

## Gameplay
* Made the green shape not so fast to improve controls
* Changed rooms to remove the unecessary deaths as punishing the players is not really what I want
* Delayed warping

## Graphics
* Making portals floaty
* Tweaked room heights, decreasing the wait time in the eventual fall
* Implemented creators that make long things (in special the killing tiles) look proper and not streched
* Randomized the glowing script so thing don't always glow like each other

# Not quite in game yet
* delayed warping
* deactivating collisions and physics

## Others
* Displaying the game name properly (changed from "a games" to "Shapes")
* Updating my e-mail to the ~formal~ e-mail (who I'm I kidding lmao)
* Several code cleanups and updates
* Restarting button for showings

# ludumdare version
The game as the ludum dare ended and I took to my fellow game devs to try out

# Shapes

## A few worlds

So, this game was my submission for Ludum Dare 35. After submitting it though, I didn't think much of it to be honest. I was happy with the results but didn't think it was really something that good.

But in came the results and they really did surprise me. I got #32 in fun and #166 in overall. I wasn't expecting it at all to be completly honest. "Maybe I could work on this." I then took it to a local game dev meeting and they also found the game quite nice. They liked the aesthecis, the level design and the simple nature of the the game so I decided to try and expand it! Hooray!

## About

The game is very simple. you walk around and jump with space and everything else I think you can figure out by playing the game. It's a really simple puzzle plataformer.

If you really wanna know more about it, you're a black square that takes diferent shapes (the theme was shapeshifting afterall), each with they're own properties that affect how you move around and what blocks you can erase out of existence. Find the warp gate and get to the next level. Simple stuff.

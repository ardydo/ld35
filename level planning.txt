        Things that I want to teach and use to solve puzzles and things like that

        Bridges
            Sometimes you'll want to not clear blocks because you'll need them to reach somewhere else

        Surprises
            The blocks can hide other elements. Since they take priority when being drawn. They can hide other blocks. Terrain and other stuff


Level Planning

    
    NEW LEVELS

            2 don't fall off
                some vertical plataforming and you killing yourself
                so. the game isn't quite the same for vertical plataforming, so i'm changing this for the time being.
                it will show the max jump range and maybe cause some falls.
                maybe.
            
            3 don't fall on the hazards
                they also kill

            4 go the distance
                get familiar with the jump distance

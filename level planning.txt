    Exploration/Navigation/I don't really know how to classify this to be honest
        Things that I want to teach and use to solve puzzles and things like that

        Bridges
            Sometimes you'll want to not clear blocks because you'll need them to reach somewhere else

        Surprises
            The blocks can hide other elements. Since they take priority when being drawn. They can hide other blocks. Terrain and other stuff

            5 hazarder
                stupid level making it clear that this red and yellow thingies kills

        w2 or the world that never was
            1 the end
                dificult curve to the max just to present some of the challenges that the actual game could present
    
    NEW LEVELS
        w1 basics
            OBJECTIVE: Introduce the basic mechanics of the game

            1 portal
                get to that portal

            2 don't fall off
                some vertical plataforming and you killing yourself
                so. the game isn't quite the same for vertical plataforming, so i'm changing this for the time being.
                it will show the max jump range and maybe cause some falls.
                maybe.
            
            3 don't fall on the hazards
                they also kill

            4 go the distance
                get familiar with the jump distance

            5 go the all of them
                get familiar with the jumping again
